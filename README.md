# Kerala_Flood_Classification_Prediction

## **Description**
The "Kerala_Flood_Classification_Prediction" project aims to predict the likelihood of floods in Kerala based on the monthly rainfall index from 1900 to 2018, while also noting instances of flood occurrences. By observing rainfall patterns, the project employs multiple models including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Classification (SVC), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and Ensemble Learning to identify and classify potential flood events. Utilizing predictive analysis techniques, the project holds the potential to enhance flood anticipation by integrating weather data and historical flood information. This endeavor seeks to develop models that aid decision-making for disaster mitigation and impact management.

## **Results and Findings**

In this project, valuable findings and results have been obtained:
1. **EDA Insights:** The analysis of the monthly rainfall distribution revealed notable characteristics. The box plot illustrated that the distribution tends to have a longer tail towards higher values, indicating instances of heavy rainfall. Additionally, the majority of months experienced low rainfall, as evident from the median value being lower than the mean. Noteworthy are the months with high rainfall, indicated by outliers significantly above the norm. This analysis also uncovered a downward trend in Kerala's weather conditions annually, affirming the two distinct seasons that characterize India's climate.
2. **Model Performance:** Notably, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model and Ensemble Learning outperformed others, achieving an impressive 91% accuracy. These models exhibit strong potential for effective flood prediction, emphasizing the importance of accurate weather forecasts in managing flood events.

These findings shed light on the dataset's characteristics, the relationship between rainfall and flooding, and the effectiveness of predictive models. The results underscore the significance of accurate weather forecasts in anticipating and managing flood occurrences in Kerala.
